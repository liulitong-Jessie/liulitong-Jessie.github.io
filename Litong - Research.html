        For this project, we aim to build various testing problems and solvers which can help people to make decisions and policies. We use python to 
        build our simulation library and solvers. I am responsible for the "COVID" problem and "Call Center" problem.

        For the COVID problem, we are trying to use simulation optimization to find an optimal vaccination distribution and testing frequencies to a 
        certain population (like Cornell) to achieve a minimum number of infections in a given period. Suppose there are m people for a n days period. 
        The original problem was formulated by tracking all infected individuals and simulate their disease progress to estimate our total number of infections, 
        which has a time complexity of O(mn). To improve the efficiency, we re-developed an algorithm which only consider the group changes for each day. 
        Now, we use multinomial distribution to do disease schedules for each group, and everyday we use multinomial to simulate the isolation schedule 
        for each group. At the corresponding day, we move the patiences to corresponding disease states or isolation states according to their disease schedule
        and isolation schedule. By doing this, the time complexity is reduced to O(kn), where k is the number of groups that population can be divided and is 
        much smaller than m.

        For special applications like financial market and insurance usually require people understand the process before making decisions. However, traditional 
        machine learning algorithms, for example random forest, have high predicting accuracy but are hard to understand the behind logic, decreasing its practicability
        in financial fields. For this project, we aim to explore different methods in interpretable machine learning and finally build an algorithm that can maintain 
        high accuracy property of traditional methods but also increase its interpretability. Currently, we are in the literature review states, everyone is responsible for
        finding some interesting algorithms each week and report and summary to others. For the next period, we are going to develop our own algorithm.

        Image segmentation is an important part in computer vision. While the deep learning methods are becoming popular these days, they usually require 
        users to tune complicated parameters and may need large data and long time to train. Different from the learning methods, traditional methods are 
        usually more efficient and easier to implement. In this project, we developed an information-driven unsupervised image segmentation model, which 
        can be applied to medical imaging model and target detection. In our algorithm, we convert image segmentation problem into concave function optimization over a 
        convex set by characteristic function, such that the optimization problem can have an explicit solution. The developed algorithm conduct segmentation 
        based on initial knowledge and data of image objects. More specifically, to preserve the topology property of an image, we project our updates by algorithm 
        to the set of simple points (i.e. the points that changes will not change the topology of the image). By considering the topology property, we are 
        able to detect some tiny structures, making the segmentation more precise and robust to noises.

        Based on the observation of Chinese stock market, we found that the average return for retail investors is much lower than the market return. To figure out 
        the reason for their bad performance and teach more investors how to reasonably invest, we aim to find explainable factors to their bad performance.
        In this project, we developed analytical framework to quantitatively analyze main factors and their corresponding importance for the low yeild 
        of individual investors in stock market. We found four potential behavioral biases for investors that may lead to their bad performance: overtrading, disposition 
        effect, chasing winners, overconfidence and lottery preference. To analyze them, we assume every time only one of the biases are corrected and we created a 
        corresponding hypothetical portfolio. By comparing the return of hypothetical portfolio and the virtual portfolio, we can determine the influence of various 
        factors on the loss degree of investors. Overall, we found that disposition effect is one of the most important fators lead to the low yield, and by correcting it,
        investors can improve their performance the most. This study explored the causal relationship between individual investors' behavioral deviation and stock market trends, 
        and provided empirical basis for constructing risk prediction indicators.

        To transmit signals in submarine efficiently, people need to develop an efficient schedule for the line and time for each transmission of signals. To simplify 
        the problem to be workable, we consider a network with N nodes with line topology with unicast transmission. Each node can transmit and receive certain communication 
        signal in a time slot. We convert our network to a graph setting, where there is an edge from node i to j if node i can send signal to node j. The time delay for 
        signal transmission is the corresponding edge weight, it can be either a rational or irrational number. Our team focus on characterize the rate region explicitly 
        and prove the continuity of rate region when the delay is precise. We found that when there are only small perturbations of delay matirx, the rate region is unchanged; 
        two line network with isomorphic static graphs have same rate region.

      Model Research and Analysis of Credit Decisions of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises

        With a limited total budget, a bank needs to decide the capital allocation for different companies and the corresponding interest rate. Usually the amount of loans a small or 
        medium company and the interest rate can get from bank depends on the credit rate level. For a trustworthy company, the default risk for bank is lower, thus bank can give it 
        lower interest rate. On the contrary, the company would get a high interest rate to compensate the potential default risk. In this competition, we aim to utilize the given data 
        of 123 companies to build a quantitative model of measuring credit risk of companies and build a loan allocation model for the bank. Since there are 302 companies do not have 
        credit history. First, to get more data, we use bootstrap to draw multiple datasets from the same distribution with train dataset. We replicate data of  credit level from A to D 
        to 1000. To measure the default risk for company, we calculate the ROI and their creditworthiness for each company. Use the credit records for train set, we fit a model to measure 
        the credit risk. For companies with higher credit rate level, we assign them a higher credit score. The total score for a company is the weighted sum of its creditworthiness and ROI. 
        The second step is to use the customer data from bank and their interest rates to fit a model to measure the relationship between interest rate and customer loss. 
        After obtaining total scores for companies and the probability of losing a potential customer, we construct an optimization model, where our objective is to get higher return, 
        which is constrained to a certain level of potential customer loss. By solving this convex optimization problem, we are able to get the optimal policy for bank to distribution the 
        annual capital.
